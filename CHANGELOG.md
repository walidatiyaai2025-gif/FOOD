# Changelog

## 1.0.4 - RTL Admin & Master Data CRUD
- Fix the Arabic admin shell so the sidebar is physically on the right and page content remains RTL.
- Add server-authoritative management centers with create, edit and delete controls for categories, brands, units, products, stores, warehouses, customers, B2B clients, B2B price tiers, promotions and banners.
- Add management entry buttons from B2C and B2B operational modules instead of leaving read-only tables without actions.
- Seed production-safe default units and B2B price tiers so a fresh installation can create products and wholesale accounts immediately.
- Guard destructive deletes when operational records still reference products, stores, warehouses, customers, units or price tiers.

## 1.0.3 - First-install Admin Access
- Redirect unauthenticated management requests to the admin login instead of a raw 401 page.
- Allow the installer-created `SUPER_ADMIN` to open B2C management surfaces before any stores exist.
- Add regression coverage that verifies the fresh-install Super Admin can open every management GET surface without permission errors.

## 1.0.2 - MySQL/MariaDB Production Installer
- Switch production and first-run database configuration to MySQL/MariaDB for cPanel hosting.
- Require `pdo_mysql`, default to port 3306, and retain PostgreSQL runtime compatibility for legacy installations.
- Add MySQL backup/restore support to the updater and validate deployment recovery against MySQL + Redis.
- Refresh the first-install setup bundle so `foodex.50sols.com` can install directly against `solscool_foodex`.

- Runtime evidence pack contains 110 real screenshots covering all 46 approved baseline screens plus Driver states in Arabic and English.
